# Minecraft Server CLI (msc)

`msc` is a Typer-based command-line companion for running your self-hosted Minecraft server. It is designed to be installed via `pipx` and run directly inside a server directory (for now) so it can read local configuration and communicate with the running container.

## Features (initial)

- `msc status` – Summaries the Docker container's state, uptime, and metadata.
- `msc server start|stop|restart` – Proxies lifecycle operations to `docker compose`.
- `msc console run` – Sends a one-off RCON command.
- `msc logs tail` – Tails `data/logs/latest.log` with optional follow mode.

Additional modules (mods, backups, etc.) will be layered on incrementally.

## Installation (current repo checkout)

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

For pipx once published:

```bash
pipx install msc
```

### pipx (local editable checkout)

While iterating locally, you can have `pipx` expose the CLI globally but still use your working tree:

```bash
pipx install --editable /home/minecraft/minecraft/msc
```

If the package is already installed, use `pipx reinstall --editable /home/minecraft/minecraft/msc` after making changes. The installed `msc` command will now reflect edits from your checkout as soon as they are saved.

## Usage

From your Minecraft server root (the same folder that contains `docker-compose.yml` and `.msc.json`):

```bash
msc status
msc server start
msc console run "say hello from msc"
msc logs tail -f
```

## Configuration

- `.msc.json` in the server root holds the persistent config (data dir, docker service, RCON details, etc.).
- `.env` (optional) can override any setting using environment variables prefixed with `MSC_` (e.g., `MSC_RCON_PASSWORD`).
- Defaults assume `data/logs/latest.log` for logs and `docker-compose.yml` defines a service named `minecraft`.

## Development

```bash
python -m msc --help
```

Future enhancements: mods manifest management, backups, schedulers, diagnostics, and multi-profile support.
